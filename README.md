# Food-Order-System-Project
The Food Order System is a command-line application designed to streamline the meal selection process for a multi-cuisine restaurant. It allows users to browse specific menus—such as Indian and Italian—and place orders by selecting items and quantities. The system includes logic to validate user input and provide a summary of the final order.

Key Features
Menu Navigation: Dynamically displays available meals based on the user's chosen food category.

Input Validation: Handles invalid food types and meal names to ensure a smooth user experience.

Order Summarization: Processes the selection and quantity to generate a clear order confirmation.
