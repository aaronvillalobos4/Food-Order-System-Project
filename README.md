# Food-Order-System-Project
The Food Order System is a command-line application designed to streamline the meal selection process for a multi-cuisine restaurant. It allows users to browse specific menus—such as Indian and Italian—and place orders by selecting items and quantities. The system includes logic to validate user input and provide a summary of the final order.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
<h3>Menu Navigation:</h3> Dynamically displays available meals based on the user's chosen food category.

<h3>Input Validation:</h3> Handles invalid food types and meal names to ensure a smooth user experience.

<h3>Order Summarization:</h3> Processes the selection and quantity to generate a clear order confirmation.


<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<h3>Python:</h3> Utilizes core programming concepts including functions, conditional logic (if/elif/else), and list management.

<h3>String Formatting:</h3> Employs f-strings for dynamic and readable console output.
